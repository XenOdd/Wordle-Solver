## About The Project

This project was created to provide a clean, visually appealing, and highly functional assistant for Wordle enthusiasts. Instead of just showing a list of words, this solver uses a tactile Neumorphic design to create a more engaging user experience. It intelligently filters a comprehensive word list based on the user's exact input, helping you find the solution faster.

## Key Features

-   **Modern Neumorphic UI:** A beautiful, soft interface with a dark theme that's easy on the eyes.
-   **Interactive Input:** Easily enter your guesses and click on each letter to cycle through its status: Gray (absent), Yellow (present), and Green (correct).
-   **Real-time Word Filtering:** The list of possible words updates instantly with every letter and status change.
-   **Intelligent Ranking:** Suggestions are ranked to help you choose the most strategic next guess.
-   **Responsive Design:** Fully functional on both desktop and mobile devices.
-   **Click-to-Fill:** Click on a suggested word to automatically fill it into your next available guess row.
